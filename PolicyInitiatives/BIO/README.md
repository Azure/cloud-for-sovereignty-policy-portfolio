# BIO Cloud Theme Policy Initiative
 The BIO Cloud Theme Policy Initiative aids in customizing deployments to reduce the time needed to audit environments and meet the BIO Cloud Theme (Baseline Informatiebeveiliging Overheid - Baseline Information Security for the Government) control objectives.The policy initiatives and files contained in this repository are intended to serve as a starting point. Please note that these files are not intended to be final or comprehensive solutions, but rather a helpful resource to jumpstart your efforts.

Important - Organizations are wholly responsible for ensuring their own compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The information provided in this document does not constitute legal advice, and organizations should consult their legal advisors for any questions regarding regulatory compliance.

The contents of this BIO Policy Initiative are:
 1. BIO Cloud Theme documentation. Reference to the BIO Cloud Theme official documentation which walks through the control objectives. This publication offers a comprehensive collection of controls for cloud service consumers in the Netherlands to protect organizational operations from a diverse set of threats and risks. The controls are flexible and customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process to manage risk.

 2. Mapping File. A file that maps the BIO Control Objectives to Azure Policies. The mapping file enables the user to identify what Azure Policies are being used to meet BIO control objectives. Each Control ID in the mapping files contains the Control Domain, Control Title, Control Description, Azure Policy Name, Azure Policy Reference ID, and Azure Policy Definition ID. An explanation of each Control can be found in the BIO Cloud Theme documentation.
