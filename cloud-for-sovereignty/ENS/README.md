# Spain ENS Built-In Policy Initiative
 The Spain ENS Policy Initiative aids in customizing deployments to reduce the time needed to audit environments and meet the Spain Esquema Nacional de Seguridad (ENS) High-Level Security Measures Policy control objectives. The policy initiatives and files contained in this repository are intended to serve as a starting point. Please note that these files are not intended to be final or comprehensive solutions, but rather a helpful resource to jumpstart your efforts.

**Important** Organizations are wholly responsible for ensuring their own compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The information provided in this document does not constitute legal advice, and organizations should consult their legal advisors for any questions regarding regulatory compliance.

The evidence against each security measure and its corresponding security controls shall be assessed to determine whether it meets the security requirements. If the security requirements are not fulfilled, the outstanding risks shall be identified. The SAA and/or NCSP shall identify any additional security measures and controls needed to attain an acceptable residual risk, which would be implemented by the NCSP and/or CSP.

The contents of this ENS Policy Initiative are:
 1. Spain ENS Policy documentation. Reference to the Spain ENS official documentation which walks through the control objectives. This publication offers a comprehensive collection of controls for cloud service consumers to protect organizational operations from a diverse set of threats and risks. The controls are flexible and customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process to manage risk.

 2. Mapping File. A file that maps the ENS Control Objectives to Azure Policies. The mapping file enables the user to identify what Azure Policies are being used to meet ENS control objectives. Each Control ID in the mapping files contains the Control Domain, Control Title, Control Description, Azure Policy Name, Azure Policy Reference ID, and Azure Policy Definition ID. An explanation of each Control can be found in the ENS Policy documentation.
