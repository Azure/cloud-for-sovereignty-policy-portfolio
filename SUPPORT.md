# Support

## General Questions

If you have questions you haven't been able to answer from the [Azure Policy documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy), there are a few places that host discussions on Azure Policy:
- [Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/) 
- [Azure Governance conversation space](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Governance/bd-p/AzureGovernance)
- Search or add to Azure Policy discussions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-policy+or+azure+policy)
- Additional information can be found in the [Azure Policy - Microsoft Q&A](https://learn.microsoft.com/answers/tags/228/azure-policy)
- If interested in authoring custom definitions, you can also leverage this [Azure/Community-Policy](https://github.com/Azure/Community-Policy) repository for contributing.

If you are encountering difficulties in implementing new policies that may be due to problems in Azure Policy itself, open a support ticket at [Azure Customer Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/). 

## Built-in Definitions

The support for addressing built-in definition issues is handled by Azure Customer Support. Open a new [Azure Customer Support ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) if you believe a definition has a bug or error.

## Azure Policy Known Issues

Check here for a current list of [known issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master#known-issues) for Azure Policy.

## How to file issues and get help  

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing
issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates.  For new issues, file your bug or
feature request as a new Issue.

Issues can be created and searched through under the "Issues" tab.

Please provide as much information as possible when filing an issue (please redact any sensitive information). We may ask you to create an Azure support request using the following process documented [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request).
